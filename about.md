I am an aspiring Data Scientist and Business Intelligence professional.  I have worked in Australia and SE Asia in performance management, data analytics, and consulting.  I have recently completed a Data Science Immersive program through General Assembly.  My capstone project explored using Convolutional Neural Networks to classify images of damaged motor vehicles by severity.

In my spare time I enjoy playing guitar and reading.
