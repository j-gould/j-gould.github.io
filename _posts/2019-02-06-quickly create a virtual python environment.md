### There will come a time when you install a python libraray and it creates havoc with your existing python environment.  Here I offer a very quick solution to enable you to install new libraries on a test or virtual environment and, if you choose, also include your existing or global libraries.

We install the virtualenv library on a unix/python3 environment.


```python
$ pip install virtualenv
```

Go to your project or test environment location.
```python
$ cd test_env/
```

```python

```
